# Titus' Awesome World Game
This is a wordle clone. My brother made the mistake of expressing interest in doing some programming so I provided him with an HTML course. He wanted me to work through the course as well, so I decided to just do the capstone.

## Setup
1. Clone the project `git clone https://github.com/titusdmoore/wordle.git`
2. `cd` into the cloned project
3. Start python web server `python3 -m http.server`
4. Navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) or [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your browser
5. Enjoy wordle

## Note for My Brother
Just kidding about the mistake part, I totally think you should be programming. The mistake is telling me, I won't let you live it down now. You and I will program together!
